## Overview

**Checkers WebGame Single Player** is a complete browser-based checkers game that faithfully implements official rules—including mandatory captures, jump chains, and king promotion (visually marked with a golden border and a "D"). The app features real-time clocks, move history, undo/reset functionality, and an intelligent bot with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

## Installation

No installations or registrations are required. Simply serve the files via an HTTP/HTTPS server (for example, using Apache) and open `index.php` in your browser.

## Usage

- **Select Color:** Choose whether you play as White or Black.
- **Select Bot Difficulty:** Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard. The bot’s search depth (and capture animation delay) adjusts accordingly.
- **Set Game Time:** Select your desired time per side (5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes).
- **Game Interaction:** Drag pieces to move. All official rules are enforced (including forced captures and promotion). The move history panel keeps track of every move.
- **Undo/Reset:** Use the Undo Move button to cancel the last move or Reset Game to restart.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
- **PHP**
- **Custom Checkers Game Engine** (with minimax & alpha‑beta pruning for the bot)
- **Bootstrap 5**
